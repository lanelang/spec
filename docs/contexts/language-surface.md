# Lane Language Surface

This context names the source-level syntax and declaration concepts visible to
Lane programmers before semantic lowering.

## Language

**Top-Level Definition**:
A named definition that may introduce a type, function, or immutable value at the outermost program scope.
_Avoid_: statement, entrypoint, main function

**Immutable Value Definition**:
A binding that gives a name to a value without permitting reassignment.
_Avoid_: variable, mutable binding

**Offered Value Definition**:
A value definition that defines a named value and immediately adds it to the contextual offer environment.
_Avoid_: anonymous offer, open binding, standalone offer form, unnamed prelude entry

**Recursive Definition Group**:
A set of top-level functions or types that may refer to one another regardless of textual order.
_Avoid_: forward declarations, hoisted statements

**Ordered Top-Level Value Scope**:
The rule that top-level immutable values may refer only to earlier available values.
_Avoid_: recursive top-level values, forward top-level value reference

**Strict Evaluation**:
The rule that an expression is evaluated when it is reached, and function arguments are evaluated before the function body runs.
_Avoid_: eager mode, non-lazy evaluation

**Keyword-Delimited Top Level**:
Top-level definitions are separated by their defining keywords rather than semicolons or MoonBit block separators.
_Avoid_: `///|` separator, semicolon-delimited top level

**MoonBit-Like Syntax**:
Lane surface syntax that follows MoonBit's expression-oriented style while excluding mutable bindings and assignment.
_Avoid_: custom syntax from scratch, MoonBit compatibility

**Type Annotation Spacing**:
The rule that a colon between a value or field name and a type is written with whitespace on both sides.
_Avoid_: compact type annotation, struct-literal field assignment

**Explicit Named Function Signature**:
A named function boundary that states every parameter type and the result type.
_Avoid_: inferred named function signature

**Generic Named Function**:
A named function whose explicit type parameter list follows `fn` and precedes the function name.
_Avoid_: name-attached type parameters

**Block Function Body**:
A function body written as a block expression rather than with an equals-sign expression body.
_Avoid_: equals body, expression-bodied function

**Arrow Return Type**:
A function result type written with `->` after the parameter list.
_Avoid_: colon return type

**Block Expression**:
A scoped expression containing local value or function bindings followed by a final value expression.
_Avoid_: statement block, local type scope

**Conditional Expression**:
An `if` expression with both then and else branches, where both branches have the same type.
_Avoid_: statement if, optional else

**Sequential Local Binding**:
A local binding that is visible only to later items in the same block.
_Avoid_: let-in expression, simultaneous local binding

**Sequential Local Function**:
A named local function that may call itself, is visible only to later items in the same block, and is not part of a forward-referenced group.
_Avoid_: local recursive group, local forward declaration

**Uncurried Function**:
A function that accepts its parameters as one call shape and is not automatically transformed into nested one-argument functions.
_Avoid_: curried function, automatic partial application

**First-Class Function Value**:
A function that can be stored, passed, returned, and called as a value.
_Avoid_: top-level-only function, method

**Struct Type**:
A nominal type defined by a fixed set of named fields.
_Avoid_: record type, anonymous record

**Enum Type**:
A nominal type defined by a closed set of named variants.
_Avoid_: sum type, tagged union

**Qualified Struct Literal**:
A struct value constructed with its struct type name followed by `::{ ... }`.
_Avoid_: anonymous record literal, unqualified struct literal

**Struct Field Punning**:
A struct literal shorthand where a field name alone means `field: field`.
_Avoid_: spread update, default field

**Struct Pattern Punning**:
A struct pattern shorthand where a field name alone binds that field to a variable with the same name.
_Avoid_: rest pattern, spread pattern

**Field Access**:
Reading a named field from a struct value with dot syntax.
_Avoid_: field update, copy update

**Selector Lowering**:
The compiler lowering that turns source field access into a generated Buslane function call.
_Avoid_: source-visible selector, Buslane field primitive

**Qualified Variant**:
An enum variant referred to through its enum type name using `Type::variant`.
_Avoid_: globally unique variant, dotted variant

**Unqualified Variant**:
An enum variant referred to by its variant name alone when that name resolves without ambiguity.
_Avoid_: mandatory qualified variant, inferred later variant

**Payloadless Variant Value**:
An enum variant without payload that is used as a value without call parentheses.
_Avoid_: zero-argument variant call

**Pipeline Expression**:
An expression `value |> call` that rewrites by passing `value` as the first argument to the call.
_Avoid_: core pipeline node, method call, placeholder pipeline

**Trailing Comma**:
An optional final comma in a comma-separated syntax list.
_Avoid_: comma-sensitive list ending

**Primitive Inhabitant**:
A value belonging to a primitive type, such as an integer literal, boolean literal, string literal, or `()`.
_Avoid_: enum variant, nominal constructor

## Relationships

- A Lane source file contains **Top-Level Definitions**, not an executable entrypoint.
- Top-level functions and types may form a **Recursive Definition Group**.
- Top-level immutable values follow **Ordered Top-Level Value Scope**.
- A top-level **Immutable Value Definition** must include an explicit type annotation.
- A function uses an **Explicit Named Function Signature**, **Arrow Return Type**, and **Block Function Body**.
- A **Block Expression** may contain **Sequential Local Bindings** and **Sequential Local Functions** followed by exactly one final expression.
- Local value names may shadow earlier value names; ordinary value bindings in the same scope must have distinct names.
- Lane functions are **Uncurried Functions** and may still be **First-Class Function Values**.
- Enum variants in expressions may be **Qualified Variants** or unambiguous **Unqualified Variants**.
- **Field Access** is source syntax and lowers through **Selector Lowering** before Buslane.
- A **Pipeline Expression** is source syntax and does not survive into Buslane or ANF.

## Example dialogue

> **Dev:** "Can a top-level value refer to a later value?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. Top-level functions and types can be recursive, but top-level values obey **Ordered Top-Level Value Scope**."
