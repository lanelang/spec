# Lane Runtime And Execution

This context names execution targets, interpreter runtime concepts, builtin
runtime plugins, and runtime error boundaries.

## Language

**Execution Target**:
A way to execute a checked Lane program, such as an interpreter or a bytecode virtual machine.
_Avoid_: host target, MoonBit target, backend platform

**Reference Interpreter**:
The first execution target, currently evaluating ANF IR, that defines observable Lane/Core behavior.
_Avoid_: source interpreter, bytecode VM

**Interpreter Entry Selection**:
The rule that a caller chooses which checked value or function to evaluate rather than the interpreter hard-coding `main`.
_Avoid_: built-in main, source entrypoint

**Run Entry Convention**:
The Lane Command convention that single-file `lane run` requires an explicit entry name and prints the selected value with debug rendering.
_Avoid_: language-level main semantics, project entrypoint, interpreter hard-code

**Run Debug Rendering**:
The Lane Command output rule that prints the selected runtime value without applying function values.
_Avoid_: implicit entry call, source pretty printing

**Interpreter Value**:
A uniform runtime value used by the reference interpreter.
_Avoid_: unboxed primitive special case, source AST node

**Global Environment**:
The interpreter environment containing initialized top-level and prelude values.
_Avoid_: module namespace, source scope

**Call Frame**:
The interpreter environment for a single function call or local evaluation scope.
_Avoid_: global scope, closure object

**Closure Environment**:
The captured interpreter environment stored with a first-class function value.
_Avoid_: call frame, lambda-lifted parameter list

**Tail-Call Optimization**:
An execution optimization that reuses a call frame for a tail-position call.
_Avoid_: required recursion semantics, function correctness

**Builtin Runtime Plugin**:
An execution-time extension that supplies behavior for unsafe builtin intrinsic names according to the compiler core contract.
_Avoid_: compiler intrinsic table, hard-coded primitive

**Builtin Dispatch Key**:
The intrinsic name and typed expected type used to select or call a builtin runtime plugin entry.
_Avoid_: name-only builtin lookup, type-checked intrinsic

**Runtime Error Report**:
An execution-target diagnostic result that reports interpreter or plugin failure without becoming a Lane language-level exception.
_Avoid_: catchable exception, panic

**Integer Undefined Behavior**:
Undefined behavior caused by invalid `Int` arithmetic such as signed overflow or division by zero.
_Avoid_: integer trap, arbitrary precision integer

## Relationships

- The first **Execution Target** currently evaluates ANF IR.
- The **Reference Interpreter** uses **Interpreter Entry Selection** over a whole checked compiler program.
- **Run Entry Convention** is a caller policy layered on top of **Interpreter Entry Selection** and selects from the final top-level environment after prelude loading.
- **Run Debug Rendering** displays function values as opaque function placeholders rather than invoking them.
- The **Reference Interpreter** separates the **Global Environment**, **Call Frame**, and **Closure Environment**.
- The **Reference Interpreter** evaluates to **Interpreter Values**.
- Lane v1 does not require **Tail-Call Optimization**.
- An **Execution Target** consumes checked compiler output rather than raw source syntax.
- Runtime type arguments are erased before execution.
- **Builtin Runtime Plugins** are selected by a **Builtin Dispatch Key**.
- A **Runtime Error Report** is not a Lane language-level exception.
- Invalid `Int` arithmetic is **Integer Undefined Behavior** in v1.

## Example dialogue

> **Dev:** "Does the interpreter decide which `main` to run?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. **Interpreter Entry Selection** belongs to the caller or later linker, not to the reference interpreter."

> **Dev:** "Can single-file `lane run` execute `main` by default?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. The **Run Entry Convention** requires an explicit entry name and debug-prints the selected value."

> **Dev:** "If the selected entry is a function, should `lane run` call it?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. **Run Debug Rendering** prints an opaque function placeholder instead of applying it."
